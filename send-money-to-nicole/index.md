You can use your bank account to send money to a Nicole. You'll need:

1. a payment reference to identify yourself
2. Nicole's's bank account and sort code

## Payment reference

Use:

- your name
- whatev lols

If you don’t know the your name, you're probably too drunk and should do this when you sober-up.

_**An example of how to write the payment reference**_

<ul class="reference">
  <li>
    <p>If your name is:</p>
    <strong>Kamala</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="plus"></i>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And your lols are:</p>
    <strong>wtf</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    <i class="arrow"></i>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You'd write:</p>
    <strong>Kamala wtf</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

## Bank details

All Nicole's in England and Wales use the same bank account to receive money for repayment of restaurant bills. Make a payment using these details:

The account number for Nicole `60277827`

The sort code for Nicole `20-96-60`

The money should arrive in Nicole's account in 2 working days <sup> * </sup>.

If you have any questions about how to make a payment you should contact your bank or building society.

## Sending money from outside the UK

You can use all the same details to make a payment outside the UK, but please consider inviting Nicole on your holiday next time:

 <sup> * </sup> Your bank may take longer to process payments (up to 3 working days). 

## Send a cheque, postal order or cash

Make sure the cheque is written out to ‘Nicole's Sky-rocket’. Send cheques, postal orders and cash in an envelope addressed to the governor of the Nicole. Your letter should include:

- your name and address
- the excuse and some lols  

The money is then paid into his account - a basic cash account he can use to send and receive money.
